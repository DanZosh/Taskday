# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple time tracking application that shows and stores tasks by hour and color codes the tasks based on relative time of day.


## HOW TO USE:

```
GIVEN you are using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN you open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN you scroll down
THEN you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN you view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN you click into a timeblock
THEN you can enter an event
WHEN you click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN you refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
